#Examples

1. Blink - Simple "Hello World" project on STDPeriph
2. Slider - Simple "Hello World" project on STDPeriph
3. Blink_CMSIS - Simple "Hello World" project. Delay realized on SysTick. GPIO controled directly by registers used CMSIS
4. MAX7219_Ex - Simple example of work with MAX7219 IC used CMSIS. SysTick, SPI1.
5. USB_CDC_ACM - Test device that rreceive data from console (on PC looks like virtual COM) and return it back. If received simbol is '0', '1' or '2' LED on PC13 change his state.
